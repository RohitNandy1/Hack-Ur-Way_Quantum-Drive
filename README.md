SafeSteps – An App for Personal Safety and Emergency Alert
________________________________________
Vision Statement
I will create SafeSteps, a mobile app that enables individuals—particularly women—to have quick, reliable, and convenient safety options in times of emergency. This app will serve as a lifesaving assistant, providing immediate means to alert close ones, send live location, and trigger protective features—all from one convenient interface.

The Problem
Personal safety is a grave issue in most of the world, especially for women traveling alone, working late at night, or venturing into unknown territory. In life-or-death scenarios, lag in accessing assistance—or not having any tool to access at all—can lead to increased risks. Professional-level safety tools are too costly, too complicated, or simply not accessible to most individuals.

The Solution: SafeSteps
SafeSteps will be a light, intuitive mobile safety app with an emphasis on real-time emergency response, location tracking, and covert safety features. It's not just an app—it’s pocket-sized peace of mind.

Core Features I Will Build
1. Emergency Panic Button
On pressing, this button will automatically send an emergency message and live location to trusted contacts.
I will also add a mechanism to initiate this panic alert using a shake gesture, providing a subtle method of calling for assistance.
2. Live Location Sharing
I will share the user's real-time GPS location with pre-established guardians or members of their family.
I will utilize Firebase for storing and updating location information dynamically, enabling related contacts to track movement if required.
3. Stealth Audio or Photo Capture
When a panic alert is triggered, the application will silently record audio or snap a photo without being noticeable.
These audio files or photos will be stored locally or securely transferred to Firebase for evidence or reviewed by trusted contacts.
4. Low Battery Auto-Alert
If the device’s battery drops below 20%, the app will automatically send a quick SMS alert with the user’s last known location.
This ensures that guardians are informed even if the phone is about to power off.
5. Fake Call / Exit Strategy
I’ll include a feature that triggers a simulated phone call, helping users exit dangerous or uncomfortable situations with a believable excuse.
This feature can be pre-programmed with a name, ringtone, and delay timer.

Why This Matters
SafeSteps will be confronting a true and pressing need—guaranteeing one's personal safety, particularly among those most at risk. It will be easy enough to employ in high-stress situations but effective enough to really make a difference.
•	It's quick
•	It's discreet
•	It's effective
•	And most importantly, it's potentially life-saving
Even a minimalist version of this app can have a significant effect. The facility to share the location in real-time, inform others immediately, and provide an immediate sense of connection in emergencies will be a game-changer for a lot of people.

Firebase’s Future Usage
In the future, soon, I shall deploy a Firebase backend to handle:
•	Real-time location updates
•	Cloud storage of audio/photo proof
•	Emergency logs and alert history
•	Guardian lists and user profiles
Firebase will enable me to scale the app with reliable real-time functionality and secure users' data, synchronize it, and make it available when needed most.

Bonus Features I Plan to Add
•	Emergency flashlight blink mode
•	SOS siren toggle button
•	Light/Dark mode for comfort and discretion
•	Safety tips and guidelines section
•	Trusted contact list with photos and profiles

This is the work completed by us on the first day of hackathon 
Today we have mainly tried to do the UI design.
 
Due to some problems regarding connecting the firebase server with flutter 
Flow, we have stopped the work for today and decided to continue on the next day.

These are some screenshot of our Firebase:
